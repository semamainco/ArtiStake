description: "I'm usually an illustrator in the game industry. My specialty is pictures with a storyline in the background."
aboutMyWork: "The art style is a fusion of 2DCG and 3DCG.
I am particularly conscious of evoking emotion through the rhythm of light.
While depicting a world where non-human beings exist, I try to create pictures with an awareness of the unique architecture and lifestyle of that world, as if I have traveled to another world."
